I will join <a href="https://cse.gatech.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Georgia Tech CSE</a> as an Assistant Professor in 2026. I am actively recruiting PhD students starting Fall 2026.<br> üîó PI website: <a href="https://pwang.pw/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://pwang.pw/</a> üîó Lab website: TBA üìß peterw@caltech.edu</p> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <p>I am currently a senior research scientist at Accenture GenAI, working on multimodal LLMs and agents. I am also affiliated with Caltech, where I did my postdoc on physical AI, working with <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar</a>. Before joining Caltech, I completed my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley on computer vision, advised by Prof. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stella Yu</a>. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and AI for medicine/science. Some recent research highlights:</p> <ul> <li>ML with minimal human supervision ‚Äì self-supervised learning from unlabeled data for recognition, detection and geometry.</li> <li>Efficient AI algorithms ‚Äì theory-driven model designs leveraging data structures like orthogonality and recurrence.</li> <li>AI for Medicine and Science ‚Äì multi-modal diagnosis with LLMs and computational imaging.</li> </ul> <h2 id="recruiting-information">Recruiting Information</h2> <p>I actively look for PhD students for Fall 2026 at Georgia Tech CSE. The school participates in five <a href="https://cse.gatech.edu/phd-programs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ph.D. programs</a>. I will mainly consider students for the following PhD programs: CSE, CS and ML. If you are interested in building next-generation machine learning and vision models and/or applying AI to biomedical and scientific problems, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! Please also <a href="https://grad.gatech.edu/admissions" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">apply to corresponding PhD programs</a>.</p> <h2 id="future-lab-directions">Future Lab Directions</h2> <h3 id="1Ô∏è‚É£-core-ml-and-computer-vision-methods">1Ô∏è‚É£ Core ML and Computer Vision Methods</h3> <ul> <li>Multi-modality, e.g. vision+X, multimodal LLMs</li> <li>Generative models and representation learning</li> <li>3D vision, world model, VLA, physical AI</li> <li>Physics-aware ML and simulation-based learning</li> </ul> <h3 id="2Ô∏è‚É£-applications-to-biomedicine-and-science">2Ô∏è‚É£ Applications to Biomedicine and Science</h3> <ul> <li>Inverse problems, computational imaging and medical imaging</li> <li>Multimodal data integration, e.g. electronic health records (EHRs)</li> <li>AI+simulation, physics and other scientific applications</li> </ul> <h2 id="why-join-us">Why Join Us</h2> <ul> <li>Work at the intersection of core ML, computer vision and real-world impact.</li> <li>PI has abundant experience in real-world applications, physical AI/sim2real, interdisciplinary collaboration and mentoring experience.</li> <li>Collaborate across Georgia Tech‚Äôs AI, computing and science ecosystems.</li> <li>Get hands-on experience in both theoretical ML and applied domains like computational imaging and real-world applications.</li> <li>Engage with a growing network of collaborators at Caltech, Berkeley and beyond.</li> <li>Strong connections with industry, supporting students for internships, co-advising, and industrial collaborations.</li> <li>Abundant computing and infrastructure (lab has its own 8x Blackwell 6000 96GB GPU, A100/H100 GPU server; gatech HPC like <a href="https://pace.gatech.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PACE</a>).</li> </ul> <p>If you‚Äôre passionate about developing foundational AI models that can understand, generate, and discover across modalities and scientific frontiers ‚Äî you‚Äôre warmly welcome to apply to Georgia Tech CSE!</p> <p>üì© Feel free to reach out peterw@caltech.edu with your CV, transcript and a short note about your research interests.</p> </body></html>
