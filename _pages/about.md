I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department](https://cms.caltech.edu/) at [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), working with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/). I am also working with [Gianmarco Pinton](https://pintonlab.web.unc.edu/people/) and [Lihong Wang](https://mede.caltech.edu/people/lvw) on applying physics-aware ML for medical imaging. Prior to joining Caltech, I completed my Ph.D. in [Vision Science](https://vision.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I worked with [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/) on fundamental machine learning and computer vision models and [Meng Lin](https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/meng-lin/) on applying them to healthcare.


**Research Interest:** My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. My research highlights:
1. **Minimally Supervised ML.** Self-supervised learning from unlabled data for recognition & detection ([TPAMI'21](https://pwang.pw/spn.html)) and for geometry ([ECCV'24](https://pwang.pw/trajSSL)).
2. **Efficient AI Algorithms.** AI models as duality to the data. Models can be made efficient if they are aware of data structures, such as orthogonality ([CVPR'20](https://pwang.pw/ocnn.html)) and recurrence ([WACV'23](https://pwang.pw/rpg.html)).
3. **AI for Health.** Minimally supervised ML for enhanced clinical effectiveness Applications include computational imaging for ultrasound ([arXiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01157)) and assistive diagnosis ([MICCAI'24](https://danielchyeh.github.io/MDPipe/)).
