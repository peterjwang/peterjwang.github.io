Postdoctoral Researcher, 
<br><a href='https://www.caltech.edu/'>California Institute of Technology</a>

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Anima AI + Science Lab](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department](https://cms.caltech.edu/) at California Institute of Technology. Prior to joining Caltech, I completed my Ph.D. in [Vision Science](https://vision.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I worked with [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/) on fundamental machine learning and computer vision models and [Meng Lin](https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/meng-lin/) on applying them to healthcare. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. I am currently on the job market.

**Research Interest:** My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. I develop machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) methods to address data insufficiency and model interpretability challenges. My techniques leverage physics simulations, reduce human supervision by learning from imbalanced data, and enhance interpretability through multi-level structure-aware representations. My goal is to incorporate domain knowledge into data-driven and interpretable models that not only perform well but also facilitate scientific discovery and provide insights for scientists and stakeholders. Notably, we developed the first method that can reconstruct lung anatomy with the commercial ultrasound device. More details can be found in my [research statement](./assets/research_statement.pdf).
