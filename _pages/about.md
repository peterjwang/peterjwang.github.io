I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), working with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/). Prior to joining Caltech, I completed my Ph.D. at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I was advised by [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/).


**Research Interest:** My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. My research highlights:
1. **ML without human supervision.** Self-supervised learning from unlabeled data for recognition & detection ([TPAMI'21](https://pwang.pw/spn.html)) and for geometry ([ECCV'24](https://pwang.pw/trajSSL)).
2. **Efficient AI Algorithms.** AI models as a duality to the data. Models can be made efficient if they are aware of data structures, such as orthogonality ([CVPR'20](https://pwang.pw/ocnn.html)) and recurrence ([WACV'23](https://pwang.pw/rpg.html)).
3. **AI for Healthcare.** Minimally supervised ML for enhanced clinical effectiveness, e.g. multi-modal diagnosis with LLMs ([MICCAI'24](https://danielchyeh.github.io/MDPipe/)) and computational imaging ([CVPR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16290)).
