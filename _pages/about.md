I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department](https://cms.caltech.edu/) at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), working with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/). Prior to joining Caltech, I completed my Ph.D. in [Vision Science](https://vision.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I worked with [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/) on machine learning and computer vision methods.


**Research Interest:** My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. My research highlights:
1. **Minimally Supervised ML.** Self-supervised learning from unlabeled data for recognition & detection ([TPAMI'21](https://pwang.pw/spn.html)) and for geometry ([ECCV'24](https://pwang.pw/trajSSL)).
2. **Efficient AI Algorithms.** AI models as a duality to the data. Models can be made efficient if they are aware of data structures, such as orthogonality ([CVPR'20](https://pwang.pw/ocnn.html)) and recurrence ([WACV'23](https://pwang.pw/rpg.html)).
3. **Inverse problems.** I develop any-resolution neural operators for inverse problems and computational imaging, e.g. MRI ([CVPR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16290)), 3D photoacoustic tomography and ultrasound ([arXiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01157)).
4. **AI for Healthcare.** Minimally supervised ML for enhanced clinical effectiveness, e.g. multi-modal diagnosis ([MICCAI'24](https://danielchyeh.github.io/MDPipe/)) and interpretable diagnosis ([Sci. Rep.'22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18933-y)).
