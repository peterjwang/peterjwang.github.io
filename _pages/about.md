I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department](https://cms.caltech.edu/) at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), working with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/). I am also working with [Gianmarco Pinton](https://pintonlab.web.unc.edu/people/) and [Lihong Wang](https://mede.caltech.edu/people/lvw) on applying physics-aware ML/operator learning for medical imaging. Prior to joining Caltech, I completed my Ph.D. in [Vision Science](https://vision.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I worked with [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/) on core machine learning and computer vision methods and [Meng Lin](https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/meng-lin/) on applying them to healthcare.


**Research Interest:** My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. My research highlights:
1. **Inverse problems.** I develop any-resolution neural operators for inverse problems and computational imaging, e.g. MRI ([CVPR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16290)), 3D photoacoustic tomography and ultrasound ([arXiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01157)).
2. **Minimally Supervised ML.** Self-supervised learning from unlabeled data for recognition & detection ([TPAMI'21](https://pwang.pw/spn.html)) and for geometry ([ECCV'24](https://pwang.pw/trajSSL)).
3. **Efficient AI Algorithms.** AI models as a duality to the data. Models can be made efficient if they are aware of data structures, such as orthogonality ([CVPR'20](https://pwang.pw/ocnn.html)) and recurrence ([WACV'23](https://pwang.pw/rpg.html)).
4. **AI for Healthcare.** Minimally supervised ML for enhanced clinical effectiveness, e.g. multi-modal diagnosis ([MICCAI'24](https://danielchyeh.github.io/MDPipe/)) and interpretable diagnosis ([Sci. Rep.'22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18933-y)).
