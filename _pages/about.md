I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Anima AI + Science Lab](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and the [Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department](https://cms.caltech.edu/) at California Institute of Technology. Prior to joining Caltech, I completed my Ph.D. in [Vision Science](https://vision.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I worked with [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/) on fundamental machine learning and computer vision models and [Meng Lin](https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/meng-lin/) on applying them to healthcare.   

I am on the 2024-2025 job market looking for full-time positions. Please feel free to reach out!


**Research Interest:** My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare. My research highlights ([more details](./assets/pdf/research_statement.pdf)): 
1. **Self-Supervised Learning.** SSL beyond semantic classification: SSL for geometry ([ECCV'24](https://pwang.pw/trajSSL)) and for physics (arXiv'24). 
2. **Efficient AI Algorithms.** AI models as duality to the data. Models can be made efficient if they are aware of data structures, such as orthogonality ([CVPR'20](https://pwang.pw/ocnn.html)) and recurrence ([WACV'23](https://pwang.pw/rpg.html)). 
3. **Healthcare Applications.** Efficient AI4Health methods with reduced human supervision. Applications include medical imaging (arXiv'24) and assistive diagnosis ([MICCAI'24](https://danielchyeh.github.io/MDPipe/)).
